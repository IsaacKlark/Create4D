This program is also was created by the word, and the four-dimensional space of this program is also was created by words. I can assume that God is the programmer of this world. We live in a three-dimensional world, which is written by the word of God. The Word of God is the law, and according to the law, the world was formed. Everything in the world exists according to the law. For example, according to the laws of physics stars and planets were formed, according to the laws of evolution, various forms of life, including man, appeared. According to the laws of mathematics, there are exists all laws of nature. Do not think that the theory of evolution and the Big Bang theory, along with geochronology, contradict the Biblical picture of the world. Books of the Bible were written thousands of years ago, when scientific knowledge was extremely scarce, but the main idea about God had to be conveyed to all people - clever and stupid, educated and uneducated, rich and poor, people of those years and people of our days. Because of this, the language of the Bible is simplified whereby many people can understand Bible. And the main emphasis of the Bible is not on the device of the universe, but on the interaction of man and God. According to the Bible, God created Adam from the earth. This does not contradict the evolution, according to which everything began with the chemical evolution of elements on earth and through intermediate forms led to the appearance of human. According to the Bible, God created the world in 6 days, according to scientific data, the world is already 13.5 billion years old, and the processes of Earth's formation and life formation lasted for millions of years. However, in according to Bible, for God one day, as a thousand years and a thousand years, as one day. Given that God is also outside of time and space, for him, 6 days can go completely different than for us, and not even in the same order. There are suggestions that days for God - it is whole ages for us. According to this version, the seventh day of creation is not yet complete. Some monks, by based on the genealogies described in the Bible, tried to calculate the time of the existence of the world and counted about 7 thousand years. However, this approach was not correct, because in the Bible, pedigrees are described not in order, but in heredity. For example, many people, including Jesus himself, are named - the son of Abraham, the son of David, although many generations passed between Abraham, David and Jesus, 14 of which were most known and described in genealogies. If God is a programmer, then the three-dimensional space in which our material world exists is not the basis of being, but the basis of being is the word of God, which forms time and space itself. All around are programs written by the word of God, including ourselves. I suppose that the word of God is the designation of mathematical expressions, the designation of a set of numbers, just as in programming, each reserved word - it is a set of ones and zeros, so also the word of God can designate a set of numbers. The number itself applies to everything, even to abstract concepts like love and fidelity, you can apply the numerical characteristics of the presence (1) or absence (0), the characteristics more / less, indicate the intensity of these sensations on a scale of 1 to 10, etc. To God, numerical characteristics like the 1 God, 3 hypostases, 2  natures of Christ, infinite power, etc., are applicable. Even assuming a situation where there is nothing at all, it can be denoted by zero in terms of having something. That is, the concept of the number itself is indestructible. You may object to me and say that the number is not the basis of the universe, but it is only a description of the properties of the universe, but from programming it is known that the number is lies at the basis. At first I numbered the boundaries of the tesseract, and then created the tesseract, and not the other way around. I suppose that in our real world, everything consists of numbers. But numbers should not be perceived in a mystical sense, like as numerologists do, for example, but in the sense in which they are understood by physicists, chemists, and the same programmers. So, I guess that all around are sets of numbers, the fragments of which are the word of God, by which God programmed our universe. The entire existing set of numbers, which can be considered infinite, can be called a matrix. However, one should not understand such a matrix in similarity, as in the film of the same name. Programming our world and the matrix of the universe does not at all mean that the whole universe lies in a larger computer. God controls this matrix, can change it, and reprogram, creating anything, changing only the parameters of numbers. Amount of numbers are an infinite, but God is infinite too. Numbers is everywhere and are everywhere and even beyond time and space, and God is everywhere, and he too is outside of time and space. Numbers are applicable to God himself, for example there are 3 hypostases, as mentioned above. Numbers have always existed, and God has always existed. Proceeding from this, it can be assumed that God himself is the basis of the whole matrix, and an overprogram capable of programming and modifying the matrix itself. Creating the world from nothing, he created it from zero, by reprogramming the code to a nonzero value. God's omnipotence is expressed by the fact that he can program any code at any time, use the word and the word will become the law of the universe. Its ubiquity is expressed in that he is everywhere, where there is a matrix, and it is everywhere, and it has no boundaries, it extends beyond space and time, which are only a part of it, created by God. The eternity of God can be explained by the fact that, since the concept of number is ineradicable, there was no moment when there was no matrix, and therefore there was no moment when there was no God. Finding God out of time can be explained by the fact that the past, the present and the future are equally accessible to him, and everything exists as if simultaneously, he can choose any period of time and make changes both in the past and in the future. The trinity of God, that is, the existence of one God in the form of three hypostases, but with a common will, and intentions, can be due to the fact that God by studying the matrix, spread to the whole of it, and had been self-copied himself. Self-copying could give rise to a second hypostasis, and the distribution to whole matrix from one center are the third one, but all three exist in a common matrix, all three are infinite, and all three have a common code. Do not forget that all three existed always and there was no moment when they were not, so the distribution and study of the matrix should not be taken literally, but only as a precondition for existence in three hypostases. The commonality of code makes them one single God. Being without a goal is meaningless. But if you can do all for yourself, there is no purpose, because all was achieved. But if we exist for the sake of others and set the goal not ourselves but others, then the existence finds meaning - to exist for the sake of others. If the goal of existence it is not yourself, but others - it is love. This can explain the reason why God is love and why he created the world.";

  document.getElementById("pr3").innerHTML = "About sins";
  document.getElementById("prop2").innerHTML = "</br>" + "Every human is a sinner. And any person from birth has a propensity for some kind of sin. Sin is a disturbed model of human behavior, in which person makes mistakes. Sin enslaves the will of human. Often having sinned with one kind of sin, it becomes very difficult for a person to stop it later. A person loses control over himself, and no longer decides how he will act, but his sin take under control behavior of person, like a malicious program takes under control a computer. If a person intends to stop this pattern of behavior, eradicate sin from himself, then sometimes it takes years, and sometimes even a whole life, to completely eradicate it. Every sin brings harm to man. But if a person commits a sin with constant regularity, but calls it sin, is this hypocrisy? No. A drug addict can take drugs, and understand that he is addicted to them and that it is bad for him, and he can to understand that it is very hard for him to give up and that he needs help, but at the same time he can call his condition as a vice. This will not be hypocrisy. Hypocrisy will be if a drug addict condemns another drug addict for drug addiction, while pretending that he himself is innocent of this sin. It is important to call sin as vice, even if you make this sin too. Do not judge people who suffer from this blemish, but call the sin as sin. Do not need to make the most common vices as a norm and do not need to legalize it. With every vice, whether it was from birth or acquired throughout life, a person must fight. This struggle is difficult, but it is necessary to root out the sin out of oneself, even if it takes decades. In our time, instead of fighting with vices, for some reason, people decided to legalize it. For example, the sin of homosexuality is a vice, as well as other types of fornication - masturbation, extramarital sexual intercourse, polygamy, a passion to viewing pornography, treason ... and everything that stirs up a person's sexual desire not with a person of the opposite sex with whom you are married is a sin. Why is this all a sin?Because it destroys family values. If kids still loves their mother and feels a blood relationship with her and feels her as native person, they treat the father already as an outsider, a stranger. They don't valued the  father like they valued their mother. Because of the sin of fornication, the mother's partner may  be not a father at all. With the presence of divorces, in one year the child will have to call one man as his father, in another year - other, in the third - the third, and in fact none of them is native to him, and is at best that man is nothing more than a tutor, like a teacher at school. Because of this, the value of paternity and the value of the family in general are lost.When a family is not valuable to a person, person focuses more on himself, selfishness and egocentrism grow, and love for others grows cold. That is why with the sin of fornication in any form it is necessary to struggle, and to eradicate it from oneself, one must learn abstinence and self-control, to avoid all that stirs sexual desire out of wedlock with a person of the opposite sex. In the event of a fall person in any sin of any nature, person must necessarily go to confession, one must repent for committing sin, then fight again, learn again abstinence and self-control, and as many times as a person will fall into a certain kind of sin. Only when a person learns self-control, only then he is truly free, because he is no under controll by malicious program, and he decides how to do  and what to do. Every sin is evil. Evil is a life without love. The first sins appeared when some persons consciously abandoned life for love and decided to live for themselves. God did not create evil. God created free will for the sake of the existence of love, because without free will love is impossible, but the presence of free will inevitably leads to the possibility to life without love as a choice option, and evil is this life without love. Over time, the evil took root in the nature of person who commited it. It was hard to make the first evil, but the affairs of love were made with ease. After the rooting of evil in human nature, it became easy for a person to do evil, and efforts must be made to accomplish the works of love. Since every person is born as sinful, we can not condemn the person for his sins, because we have sins too, we must love person, even person with sins. But we must to hate sin itself, and we must always call sin as sin.";

During the fasting, the will power and strength of self-control are trained. Together with this man learns to abstain from sins. Jesus Christ himself fasted and spoke about demons, that this generation is expelled by fasting and prayer. Refusal of fasts is a refusal of one of the strongest ways of struggle against sins.";

And to pray to angels, asking them to ask God for something - is not a sin, you can also pray to the Theotokos, as she gave birth to Christ himself and, according to the status, even above the angels. And of course we should always pray to God Himself. In prayer, we can not only ask, but also glorify the God, and also express our faith. During prayer, you can not only use words, but also you can use a gesture. If person crossed himself - he made is a prayer gesture.  Use collected together three fingers - thumb, forefinger and middle finger to cross yourself - it is expresses faith in the Trinity. The ring finger and little finger are pressed to the palm of the hand, which expresses faith in the 2 natures of Jesus Christ - human and divine. We should to cross oneself with the right hand, lifting three fingers first to the forehead, then to the stomach, then to the right shoulder, and then to the left shoulder, depicting the cross during prayer. We can pray for the deceased. If they are in hell, we can to pray for them, then God, seeing that there are people for whom the deceased had value, can alleviate the sufferings of the deceased in hell, and even can free a person from hell if they pray diligently for him.

However, we shold pray not to the icon itself and not to the image on it, but to the one who is depicted on it. The icon can be compared with skype. We can see another person through the computer monitor and communicate with him, we can even kiss relatives through the monitor, but at that time we do not communicate with the monitor, not with a computer, and not with a picture on the computer, but we communicate with relatives. So it is with icons. During the prayer near the icon, we are pray not to the icon, but to the one who is depicted on it. Since you can apply to the saints and to the angels and  to the Theotokos, accordingly there are icons of saints, angels and the Theotokos. You can object to me that there is a commandment which forbidding the image of everything that is above and everything that is below and everything that is on earth forbidding  to pray to them and to worship to them. But, I repeat, that prayer goes not to the icons themselves, but to those who are depicted on them. In addition, the image of the angels was made in the ark of the covenant by the behest of God Himself. Also the images of the angels were made in the temple of Solomon, and God accepted that temple. In addition to icons, a cross is also used. The fact is that Jesus Christ voluntarily went to the crucifixion in order to die like a man on a par with robbers, and go down to hell on a par with robbers. In hell, he conquered the power of hell, crushed hell, destroyed the kingdom of the devil, freed the captives righteous from hell and opened a paradise for people. Seeing the cross, demons always remember those events with fear, they remember how through this tool God Himself destroyed what they had been building for centuries, freed millions of people they had trapped for thousands of years, crushed their power, weakened them, and then defeated death itself and he had resurrected himself. That is why the demons are afraid of the cross, because when they look at it, they immediately recall all these events and they are extremely unpleasant for them.";

Neither catholicism, which arose in 1054, nor protestantism, which arose even later, is not the church that Christ founded. Otherwise, it turns out that the Church of Christ was defeated by the gates of hell and it was required to found a new church. The Orthodox Church is the same apostolic church that Christ founded, which passed through the 7 Ecumenical Councils on which the canon of the Bible was composed, and separated from the apocrypha. At the Ecumenical Councils, in addition to the composition of the canon of the Bible, the symbol of faith and dogmas were established, and until 1054 the whole church was united. In 1054, the Roman bishop declared himself the head of the church as opposed to the description in the Bible that Christ is the head of the church, in addition to this, a number of new dogmas are being introduced. All these innovations were accepted by a part of believers, and were not accepted by another part of the believers. Those who accepted these innovations - are called catholics, and those who did not accept, and left everything, as it was in the Apostolic Church, are called Orthodox. Precisely because the Orthodox Church retained apostolic succession and continued to exist in the form in which the apostolic church existed, Orthodox Church is true Church. Because it has never been interrupted and has existed since the time of Christ and it was founded by him, and according to Christ, this church will never be interrupted. That is why there is no need to establish new churches. Yet other churches, which is not Orthodox, are founded by people parallel to the church that is founded by Christ.
